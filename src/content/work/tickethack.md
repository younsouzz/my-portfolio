The Tickehack website provides a convenient solution for booking train tickets using journeys retrieved from a JSON object.

With a carefully designed user interface, information about various journeys is displayed clearly, allowing users to easily browse available options and select the ones that best suit their needs.

The magic happens thanks to the use of the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. The site leverages the potential of the DOM to create real-time interactions with the user. When a user selects a specific journey, JavaScript manipulates the DOM to display details of the selected journey, including fare and availability information.
