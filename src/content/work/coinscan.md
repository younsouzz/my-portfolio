#### Presentation

Coin Scan is a modern web application built with Next.js that provides real-time tracking of top cryptocurrencies. Featuring a sleek, futuristic design with an electric blue on dark theme, it offers an immersive visual experience.

The project integrates the CoinGecko API to fetch up-to-date data on the top 10 cryptocurrencies, displaying their name, symbol, image, and current price. Designed to be lightweight and fast, Coin Scan is deployed on Vercel, ensuring optimal availability and minimal load times.

This project showcases my skills in modern front-end development, third-party API integration, and cloud deployment, with a strong focus on user experience and performance.
